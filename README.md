# GOTH Stack üêà‚Äç‚¨õüñ§

## Overview

This project is a template for the GOTH stack, which combines:

- **Go**: A statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency.
  - **Echo**: A high performance, minimalist Go web framework.
  - **templ**: An HTML templating language for Go that helps in creating reusable UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **HTMX**: A lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML.
